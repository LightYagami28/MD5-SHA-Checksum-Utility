# MD5-SHA-Checksum-Utility

## ‚ùì Overview
MD5-SHA-Checksum-Utility is a user-friendly graphical tool designed to calculate and verify MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 checksums. The tool features a clean GUI with drag-and-drop file support, copy-to-clipboard functionality, and the ability to save results to a file. It also supports scanning folders to calculate hashes for multiple files.

## üí™ Features

- **Drag and Drop Support**: Easily drag files into the application to calculate checksums.
- **Multiple Hash Algorithms**: Supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy checksum results to the clipboard.
- **Save Results**: Save checksum results to a text or JSON file.
- **Verify Hashes**: Verify the integrity of files by comparing generated and provided hashes.
